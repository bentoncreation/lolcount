== LOLCount

This was a little experiment to see who the funniest user on Twitter was, based on mentions and retweets of that person with the hash #LOL in the tweet. I was thinking that, perhaps, I would build it out as a way to track one's humor ranking on Twitter. (And it was a good excuse to play around with Twitter's API, okay? Don't judge.)

I wrote and designed this app in about a weekend's time. I logged Twitter data from October 12, 2010 - September 17, 2011. At the end of that time, I'd had my fill of inane tweets from silly teenagers. (By the way, Justin Bieber has more LOLs directed as his person than any one person should.) I decided that maybe some web apps should not be made. Maybe this was such a one.

I'm now offering this body of code to science.

This app was made possible by Ruby on Rails, John Nunemaker’s Twitter gem, tweetimage.es and The League of Moveable Type’s Sniglet. Design & code by bentoncreation.
